ofxWebm
-------
Experimental addon to encode RGB data into a vp8/webm encoded video using raw rgb pixels. 
It works on Mac, not yet on linux/windows.


How to use
----------
Create a ofxWebm object and call addFrame() after you've drawn everything you want to write into a video file. There is something with the database where the videos are stored.
